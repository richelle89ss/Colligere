## 1. Java 

![Alt Text](https://www.codenotfound.com/assets/images/logos/java-logo.png)

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) : Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

## 2. HTML & CSS 

![Alt Text](https://cfe2-static.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/html-basics/images/htmlbasics.png)

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) : Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) : Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

## 3. Python

![Alt Text](https://www.h-its.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png)

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) : Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.
Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.

## 4. Visual Basic

![Alt Text](https://www.gizbot.com/img/2013/11/20-microsoftvisualstudio.jpg)

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) : Visual Basic is a third-generation event-driven programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft for its Component Object Model (COM) programming model first released in 1991 and declared legacy during 2008. Microsoft intended Visual Basic to be relatively easy to learn and use. Visual Basic was derived from BASIC, a user-friendly programming language designed for beginners, and it enables the rapid application development (RAD) of graphical user interface (GUI) applications, access to databases using Data Access Objects, Remote Data Objects, or ActiveX Data Objects, and creation of ActiveX controls and objects.

## 5. C

![Alt Text](https://udemy-images.udemy.com/course/750x422/523966_5833.jpg)

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) : C (/ˈsiː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.

## 6. C#

![Alt Text](http://www.horizonsofts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/csharp.jpg)

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) : C# (pronounced as see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. 

## 7. C++

![Alt Text](https://www.visualstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DesktopApplications_636x300OP.png)

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) : C++ (pronounced cee plus plus /ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM.
