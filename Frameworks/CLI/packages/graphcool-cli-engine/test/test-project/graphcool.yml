# Welcome to Graphcool!
#
# This file is the main config file for your Graphcool Project.
# It's very minimal at this point and uses default values.
# We've included a hello world function here.
# Just uncomment it and run `graphcool deploy`
#
# Check out some examples:
#    github.com/graphcool/examples
#
# Here are the reference docs of this definition format:
# https://docs-next.graph.cool/reference/basics/project-configuration-opheidaix3
#
# Happy Coding!


# In the types.graphql you define your data schema
types: ./types.graphql


# uncomment this:

# functions:
#   hello:
#     handler:
#       code:
#         src: ./src/hello.js
#     type: resolver
#     schema: ./src/hello.graphql


# Model/Relation permissions are used to limit the API access
# To take the burden of thinking about those while development, we 
# preconfigured the wildcard ("*") permission that allows everything
# Read more here:
# https://docs-next.graph.cool/reference/auth/authorization/overview-iegoo0heez
permissions:
- operation: "*"

  
# Your root tokens used for functions to get full access to the API
