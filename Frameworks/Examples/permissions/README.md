# Permissions (Authorization & Authentication)

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to configure **permission rules** for your application, in combination with an email-password based authentication workflow. It contains the service definition for a simple "Instagram"-app where users can share posts with their friends.

> The focus of this example is explaining how the Graphcool permission system works. If you're looking for a dedicated authentication example, check out the [auth](../auth) directory.

This is the data model for the application (defined in [`types.graphql`](./types.graphql)):

```graphql
enum Role {
  ADMIN
  CUSTOMER
}

type User @model {
  id: ID! @isUnique
  role: Role!
  posts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "UserPosts")
  email: String @isUnique
  password: String
}

type Post @model {
  id: ID! @isUnique
  description: String!
  imageUrl: String!
  author: User! @relation(name: "UserPosts")
}
```

Here is an overview of the file structure in this example:

## Get started

### 1. Download the example

Clone the full [graphcool](https://github.com/graphcool/graphcool) repository and navigate to this directory or download _only_ this example with the following command:

```sh
curl https://codeload.github.com/graphcool/graphcool/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 graphcool-master/examples/permissions
cd permissions
```

Next, you need to create your GraphQL server using the [Graphcool CLI](https://graph.cool/docs/reference/graphcool-cli/overview-zboghez5go).

### 2. Install the Graphcool CLI

If you haven't already, go ahead and install the CLI first:

```sh
npm install -g graphcool
```

### 3. Create the GraphQL server

You can now [deploy](https://graph.cool/docs/reference/graphcool-cli/commands-aiteerae6l#graphcool-deploy) the Graphcool service that's defined in this directory. Before that, you need to install the node [dependencies](package.json#L14) for the defined functions:

```sh
yarn install      # install dependencies
graphcool deploy  # deploy service
```

When prompted which cluster you'd like to deploy, chose any of `Backend-as-a-Service`-options (`shared-eu-west-1`, `shared-ap-northeast-1` or `shared-us-west-2`) rather than `local`. 

> Note: Whenever you make changes to files in this directory, you need to invoke `graphcool deploy` again to make sure your changes get applied to the "remote" service.

That's it, the service is now deployed and you can start sending queries and mutation to its API ðŸŽ‰


## Usage

The easiest way to test the deployed service is by using a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground).

### Open a Playground

You can open by pasting the HTTP endpoint for the GraphQL API into the address bar of a browser. To get access to the endpoint, use the following command in the terminal:

```sh
graphcool info
```

From the printed endpoints, chose the one for the **Simple API** and paste it into the address bar of your browser.

> Note: You can not properly verify permission rules inside the _standalone_ Playground app, since it gives you root access to all API operations.

### Creating a new user and getting an authentication token with the `signupUser` mutation

You can send the following mutation in the Playground to create a new `User` node and at the same time retrieve an authentication token for it:

```graphql
mutation {
  signupUser(
    email: "alice@graph.cool" 
    password: "graphql"
    role: CUSTOMER
  ) {
    id
    token
  }
}
```

### Authenticate requests

To authenticate requests that you're sending through the Playground, you need to set the token you just received as the `Authorization` HTTP header. You can do so in the bottom-left corner of the Playground:

### Veriyfing permission rules

See [below](#permission-rules) for a list of all permission rules configured for this service. Here are instructions to test a few of them:

##### Testing `Post.create`

Only authenticated `User`s are able to create `Posts` (see the [rule](./graphcool.yml#L30)).

Send the following mutation to test the permission, **without having the HTTP `Authorization` header set**:

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(
    description: "Great sunset"
    imageUrl: "http://example.org/sunset.png"
    authorId: "__AUTHOR_ID__" # replace with the `id` of the `User` you created before
  ) {
    id
  }
}
``` 

This will return an error with the following `message`: "Insufficient permissions for this mutation".

When setting the HTTP `Authorization` header as described above, the same mutation will create a new `Post` node. 

##### Testing `Post.delete`

To delete a node of type `Post`, a `User` must be authenticated and either the `author` of the `Post` or an `ADMIN` (see the [rule](./graphcool.yml#L30)):

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePost(
    id: "__POST_ID__" # replace with the `id` of the `Post` you created before
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

This mutation will only work if the `User` that's sending the request (i.e. who the token in the `Authorization` HTTP header belongs to) is the `author` of the `Post` to be deleted, or if it's an `ADMIN`.

## What's in this example?

### Permission rules

Here's a list of all [permission rules](./graphcool.yml#L21) that are configured for this service:

##### `Post`

- `Post.read`: Everyone can **read** the fields `description` and `imageUrl` on nodes of type `Post`
- `Post.create`: Only authenticated users can **create** nodes of type `Post`
- `Post.update`: To **update** a node of type `Post`, a `User` must be:
  - authenticated
  - the `author` of the `Post` (see the permission query `UpdatePost` in [`src/permissions/Post.graphql`](./src/permissions/Post.graphql))
- `Post.delete`: To **delete** a node of type `Post`, a `User` must be:
  - authenticated
  - either the `author` of the `Post` or an `ADMIN` (see the permission query `DeletePost` in [`src/permissions/Post.graphql`](./src/permissions/Post.graphql))

##### `User`

- `User.read`: Everyone can the fields `email` and `posts` **read** nodes of type `User`
- `User.create`: `User` nodes can only be **created** with a [root token](https://graph.cool/docs/reference/auth/authentication/authentication-tokens-eip7ahqu5o#root-tokens) (see the code for the [`signup`](./src/email-password/signup.js) function)
- `User.update`: To **update** the fields `email`, `password` and `posts` on a node of type `User`, a `User` must be:
  - authenticated
  - either the "owner" of the `User` or an `ADMIN` (see the permission query `UpdateUserData` in [`src/permissions/.graphql`](./src/permissions/User.graphql))
- `User.update`: To **update** the field `role` on a node of type `User`, a `User` must be:
  - authenticated
  - an `ADMIN` (see the permission query `UpdateUserRole` in [`src/permissions/User.graphql`](./src/permissions/User.graphql))
- `User.delete`: To **delete** a node of type `User`, a `User` must be:
  - authenticated
  - either the "owner" of the `User` or an `ADMIN` (see the permission query `DeleteUser` in [`src/permissions/deleteUser.graphql`](./src/permissions/deleteUser.graphql))


##### `UsersPosts` (relation)

- `UsersPosts.connect`: To **connect** a `Post` node with a `User` node via the `UserPosts` relation, a `User` must be authenticated
- `UsersPosts.disconnect`: To **disconnect** a `Post` node from a `User` node in the `UserPosts` relation, a `User` must be authenticated


### Permission queries

Graphcool uses the concept of [permission queries](https://graph.cool/docs/reference/auth/authorization/permission-queries-iox3aqu0ee) to configure permission rules for a service.

Permission queries are special GraphQL queries that only return `true` or `false` (it's thus unnecessary to specify the _selection set_ of the query when writing it).

Before an operation (e.g. `Post.create`) is performed against the GraphQL API of a Graphcool service, Graphcool will check the permission rules for that operation specified in [`graphcool.yml`](./graphcool.yml). If the permission rules reference one or more permission queries, Graphcool will first execute these permission queries. The requested operation will only be performed if all permission queries return `true`.
