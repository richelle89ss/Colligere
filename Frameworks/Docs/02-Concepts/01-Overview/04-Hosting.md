# Hosting


## Hosted Platform

Graphcool is available as a full-blown and production-ready hosted solution.

When you're choosing this option, the regular pricing plans apply and you get all benefits of a highly-scalable infrastructure. You can manage your project through the Graphcool CLI and get additional monitoring, collaboration and other features through the Graphcool console.


## Self-Hosting & On-Premise

Graphcool can also be deployed to proprietary infrastructure rather than the default infrastructure that's provided by the Graphcool platform.

When you're choosing this option, you'll have full control over all the components that are powering your backend.
