""" This module is an example of the Enthought Python coding standards.

It was adapted from the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 (aka PEP 8) titled
'Style Guide for Python Code' (http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html).

The first item in a module must be a documentation string (docstring).  The
first line of the docstring should be a one line summary.  If a more
detailed description is required, put an empty line before it.

Package names are lowercase with an underscore to separate each word and are
ALWAYS singular:-

e.g.

    widget
    event_handler

Module names are lowercase with an underscore to separate each word.

e.g.

    coding_standard.py
    my_class.py


Module Length
-------------
A python module should under normal circumstances be no longer than 500 lines
of code *including* comments (and even that's pushing it!).  There are certain
mitigating circumstances such as modules containing a collection of related
library functions, but even then, think about any possible logical groupings
and split them up accordingly.

"""

# Indentation
# -----------
# Each indentation level should be 4 spaces.  Code should always be indented
# with spaces only.  Code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be
# converted to using spaces exclusively (In Emacs, make sure that
# 'indent-tabs-mode' is nil, or select the whole buffer and hit
# ESC-x untabify).  When invoking the python command line interpreter with the
# -t option, it issues warnings about code that illegally mixes tabs and
# spaces.  When using -tt these warnings become errors.  These options are
# highly recommended!

# Line length
# -----------
# Lines must not exceed 79 characters in length (in deference to Emacs users...
# ... as Emacs wraps on the 80th column).
#
# The preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python's implied line
# continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces. If necessary, you can
# add an extra pair of parentheses around an expression, but somtimes using a
# backslash looks better.  Make sure to indent the continued line
# appropriately.  Emacs Python-mode does this right.


# Import Statements
# -----------------
# Import statements are always put at the top of the file, just after any
# module comments and docstrings, and before any module globals and constants.
#
# Imports should be grouped and ordered as follows:-
#
# 1. Standard library imports
# 2. Related major package imports (i.e. all email package imports next).
# 3. Application specific imports.
# 4. Local imports (ie. local to the current package).
#
# You should put a blank line between each group of imports.
#
# Relative imports for intra-package imports are highly discouraged.  Always
# use the absolute package path for all imports.
#
# Imports should be USUALLY be on separate lines:-

# Standard library imports.
import os
import sys

# Although it is okay to say this:-
from types import StringType, ListType

# And I think this looks OK to as long as it doesn't turn into a list
# of more than ~5.
import os, sys

# Major packages.
import wx
import chaco

# Application specific imports.
from baz import Baz

# Local imports.
from local import Local

# The following form of the import statement should be used with EXTREME
# caution, and only when importing names from a large and fundemental package
# such as Numeric or scipy, and even then, only when there are a large number
# of names being imported (for example, do not use 'from Numeric import *' if
# 'from Numeric import array will do ;^).
from mypackage import *

# Comments
# --------
#
# Comments are a great.  Learn to write good comments.  Or else!  Comments that
# contradict the code are worse than no comments.  Always make a priority of
# keeping the comments up-to-date when the code changes!
#
# Comments should be complete sentences.  If a comment is a phrase or
# sentence, its first word should be capitalized, unless it is an identifier
# that begins with a lower case letter (never alter the case of identifiers!).
#
# Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of
# complete sentences, and each sentence should end in a period.
#
# You should use two spaces after a sentence-ending period, since it makes
# Emacs wrapping and filling work consistently.
#
# When writing English, Strunk and White apply.

# Docstrings
# ----------
#
# The first line of a docstring should be a one line summary. As noted in the
# example below.  Follow that line with a blank line, and then continue with a
# description or examples as appropriate.  Examples are called out on a new
# line, indented an additional four spaces, and begin with >>>.
# This convention will produce nicely formated examples in the resulting html
#  pages, so do not hesitate to use it.  Conventions for writing good
# docstrings are found in PEP 257 (http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0257.html).

    # Block comments generally apply to some (or all) code that follows them,
    # and are indented to the same level as that code.  Each line of a block
    # comment starts with a # and a single space (unless it is indented text
    # inside the comment).
    #
    # Paragraphs inside a block comment are separated by a line.
    s = x + y + z

    # An inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement.
    # Inline comments should be used SPARINGLY.  Inline comments should be
    # separated by at least two spaces from the statement.  They should start
    # with a # and a single space.
    #
    # Remember to use SPARINGLY, although sometimes, they can be useful:-
    s = s + 1    # Compensate for the border.
