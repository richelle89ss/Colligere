The appearance changes were again minimal for 1972. The 1972 Corvette was the last to feature front and rear chrome bumpers, a bright "egg crate" grill, side fender grills and the removable rear window. This was the last year for the RPO-LT1 and RPO-ZR1, although the ZR1 code was again used in 1990 and the LT1 designated a new base engine in 1992.
