The 1971 Corvette was one of the model years least changed in appearance. A labor dispute in May of 1969 caused the 1969 model production to run long, shortening normal 1970 production by over four months. To compensate Chevrolet then treated 1971 Corvette production as an extension of 1970. GM also directed it's divisions to cut octane requirement in all 1971 engines, this effort carried a higher priority than appearance changes. One visible clue to a 1971's outward appearance is amber parking light lenses, although some very early production had clear lenses.
