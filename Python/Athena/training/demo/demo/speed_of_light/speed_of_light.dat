# Simon Newcomb measured the time required for light to travel from his 
# laboratory on the Potomac River to a mirror at the base of the Washington 
# Monument and back, a total distance of about 7400 meters. These measurements 
# were used to estimate the speed of light. The datafile contains the estimated 
# speed of light for 66 trials.
#
# Here are Newcomb’s 66 repetitions of his experiment. 
# Newcomb measured the time in seconds that a light signal 
# took to pass from his laboratory on the Potomac River to a mirror at the base of 
# the Washington Monument and back, a total distance of about 7400 meters. Just as 
# you can compute the speed of a car from the time required to drive a mile, 
# Newcomb could compute the speed of light from the passage time. Newcomb’s first 
# measurement of the passage time of light was 0.000024828 second, or 24,828 
# nanoseconds. The entries here record only the deviation from 24,800 nanoseconds. 
# The table entry 28 is short for the original 0.000024828.
