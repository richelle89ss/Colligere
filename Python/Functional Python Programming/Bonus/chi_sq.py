# See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution
#
# Given a sum-of-squares value, :math:`\chi^2`, and degrees of freedom, :math:`f`.
# We can compute :math:`p=1-F(\chi^2;k)` which is the probability of the
# :math:`\chi^2` being random.
# A value of :math:`p \leq 0.05` means the data is unlikely to be random. A value
# of :math:`p > 0.05` means that the null hypothesis is probably true:
# the data is random. The higher the :math:`p` value, the more likely that
# the null hypothesis is true.
#
# This requires the complete and incomplete gamma functions,
# :math:`\gamma(s,z)` and :math:`\Gamma(t)`. These can be fairly complex
# calculations.
