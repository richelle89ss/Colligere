This is a way to exercise the shopping cart 
from a pure text file containing tests.

First, we need to import the modules
>>> from cart import *

Now, we can create an instance of a cart
>>> cart = ShoppingCart()

Now we try to access an item out of range,
expecting an exception.
>>> cart.item(5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: list index out of range

We also expect the price method to fail 
in a similar way.
>>> cart.price(-2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: list index out of range
