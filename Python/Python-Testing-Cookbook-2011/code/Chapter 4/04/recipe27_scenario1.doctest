This is a way to exercise the shopping cart 
from a pure text file containing tests.

First, we need to import the modules
>>> from cart import *

Now, we can create an instance of a cart
>>> cart = ShoppingCart()

Here we use the API to add an object. Because
it returns back the cart, we have to deal with
the output

>>> cart.add("tuna sandwich", 15.00) #doctest:+ELLIPSIS
<cart.ShoppingCart object at ...>

Now we can check some other outputs

>>> cart.item(1)
'tuna sandwich'
>>> cart.price(1)
15.0
>>> cart.total(0.0)
15.0
