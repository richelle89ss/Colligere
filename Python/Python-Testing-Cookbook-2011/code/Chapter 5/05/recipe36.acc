As a store customer
I want to put things into my cart
So that I can verify the store's functionality.

Scenario 1 - Inspect empty cart in detail
Given
    I go to "http://localhost:8000"
When
    I click "Cart" link and wait
Then
    I see that current page contains "Your cart is empty"
    And I see that current page contains "0 - $0.00"

Scenario 2 - Load up a cart with 2 of the same
Given
    I go to "http://localhost:8000"
When
    I click "Science Fiction" link
    And I click "Robots Attack!" link and wait
    And I fill "quantity" textbox with "2"
    And I click "addcart" button
    And I click "Cart" link and wait
Then
    I see that current page contains "Robots Attack!"
    And I see "quantity" textbox contains "2"
    And I see that current page contains "<td align="center">$7.99</td>"
    And I see that current page contains "<td align="center">$15.98</td>" 
    And I see that current page contains "<td>$15.98</td>"
