As a system administrator
I want to login to Django's admin page
So that I can check the product catalog.

Scenario 1 - Logging in to the admin page
Given
    I go to "http://localhost:8000/admin"
When
    I fill "username" textbox with "gturnquist"
    And I fill "password" textbox with "password"
    And I click "login" button and wait
Then
    I see that current page contains "<a href="product/product/">Products</a>"

Scenario 2 - Check product catalog
Given
    I am logged in with username "gturnquist" and password "password"
When
    I click "Products" link and wait
Then
    I see that current page contains "robot-attack"
